ideas dropped :
1. idea dropped -  spinner can be made as a seperate reusable component
reason - no need to make things complicated and inefficient.
2. idea dropped - check whether in password guard , routerStateSnapshot can be used to get the data from username
component , so that from the username component we will not need to set from data in authService.
reason - reason : we cant get the vairaibles of username component in router state
